# Getting Started with Google Cloud Platform - Your own virtual machine.
If your account does not have a GCP project, you must create one to follow the steps. Only one project owned by you is needed for all tasks in this document.
- [ ] To create a project (if not automatically created) then click on the project list (above) and click New Project.
- [ ] The new project window appears. Enter a unique project name for your content. Your account is an individual one, so no organization will be set.
- [ ] Once created, select this project to continue.

## Run a GCP Virtual Machine to test ArcGIS Server
These instructions copy and launch a virtual machine image into your account. These steps only need to be done once to copy the VM into your account. After, you can stop/start your copy of the image to work with ArcGIS Server.

- [ ] Open google cloud console and enable CGP Compute Engine API (if not already enabled). This is what will be used to create the virtual machine (VM).
- [ ] Once enabled open the Compute Engine console to start creating the new virtual machine.
- [ ] Once in the compute engine console, initiate the Create Instance tool using the button (the button might be hidden in the ellipsis (... but vertical) depending on your screen width).
- [ ] Name the VM apropriately.
> First, name the virtual machine. The recommended name is arcgisserver-geom99, but this can be set to anything meeting GCP’s requirements without concern.
> The cloud is not a mythical place—it always has a location, and in this case we will be creating this virtual machine on a server in Iowa (take a look at the facility on google maps: https://goo.gl/maps/MQi2Hb1A18AqXZPA6)
